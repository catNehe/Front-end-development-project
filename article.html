                                <p>White tigers are an interesting species that
                                have been capturing the
                                imagination of wildlife enthusiasts since ages now. These
                                magnificent creatures are rarely seen in the wild and are primarily
                                found in zoos across India.But imagine experiencing white tigers in
                                their natural habitat, walking handsomely and freely in the Indian
                                jungles! Sounds interesting, right? Well, but there are very few
                places in India, where there are chances of spotting the white
                tigers. Though it’s an unproposed journey that many wildlife
                enthusiasts embark on, who knows when we get lucky enough? For those
                who don’t know, white tigers are often referred to as bleached
                tigers. They exhibit a stunning white appearance attributed to a
                lack of yellow and orange pigments, resulting in a light coloration.
                Also, India is the world's first country to introduce the white
                tiger safari in Madly Pradesh. Apart from Mashy Pradesh, there are
                just four more locations in India where one can catch a glimpse of
                these handsome animals. Have a look: Bandhavgarh National Park is
                famous for its population of Bengal tigers, including the elusive
                white tigers. Once upon a time, the forests of Bandhavgarh used to
                be home of these majestic creatures. Having once served as hunting
                grounds for the Maharajas of Rewa, the jungle was later designated
                as a Tiger Reserve in 1993. Visitors can enjoy jeep safaris to
                explore the park and increase their chances of encountering a white
                tiger in the wild. The lush greenery of the Nilgiri Hills in Tamil
                Nadu offers a perfect backdrop for wildlife enthusiasts seeking to
                spot white tigers. While not as common as in other regions,
                sightings of white tigers have been reported in the forests of the
                Nilgiri. Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan is noted for its
                population of Bengal tigers, including the occasional sighting of
                white tigers. The park's rugged terrain, dotted with ancient ruins
                and scenic landscapes, offers a unique setting for wildlife safaris.
                Kananga is all about its population of Indian rhinoceroses,
                Kananga National Park in Assam is also home to a diverse range of
                wildlife, including white tigers. Visitors can go on jeep safaris or
                elephant rides to explore the park's different zones and catch sight
                of a white tiger roaming around. Sundarbans is the world's largest
                mangrove forest! It is famous for its Royal Bengal tigers, including
                the occasional sighting of white tigers. Cruising through the
                network of creeks and channels, visitors can witness the unique
                ecosystem of the Sundarbans while keeping an eye out for these rare
                and elusive predators.
